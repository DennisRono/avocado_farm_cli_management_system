# Avocado Farm Management System CLI

## Project Overview

The **Avocado Farm Management System CLI** is a command-line-based application designed to streamline the management of avocado farms. Managing an avocado farm involves numerous tasks, such as tracking tree health, irrigation scheduling, harvest planning, inventory control, and expense tracking. Traditional methods like spreadsheets and paper records can be inefficient and prone to errors. This system aims to simplify and automate these processes, enabling farmers to focus on productivity, profitability, and better decision-making.

By using a command-line interface (CLI), the system is lightweight and accessible on virtually any system, providing an easy-to-use solution for avocado farm managers to handle day-to-day operations efficiently.
